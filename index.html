			<h3>Master od War-Bob Dylan</h3>
			<p>Master of War is a pacifistic song against war written by Bob Dylan in 1963. It is a Folk song released on the album “The Freewheelin’Bob Dylan”. Master of wars does not mean a person who is the leader of an army or arm machine, Master refers to the political leaders or the person who is leading the country.</p>
			<p>People are forced to join the war not because the want but because the political leaders wants them to join the war. Dylan say that the war machine are not made by a manufacture company or by any people, but it is built by the so called government who live in the central house of the state. Government never go to the war but they are the one who create war. They are the one responsible for the war. There is never a war between country and people of country, the war is feed into the brain of citizen by the government.</p>
			<p>The world is a free place for every human being living in here, but the dispute between to government creates war and the one who suffers from it is the local people not the government or so called leaders. And yes it is not an antiwar song, it does not say people to stop war but what Dylan is trying to say is that the war is created by the government for their own good not for the country or the people of the country.</p>
